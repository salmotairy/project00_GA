# project00_GA(Tic-Tac-Toe)

## Preface

Here is a first version from my first game **Tic Tac Toe.** The game is very simple and we choose to lunch it due to a deadline set before.However, there will be a new version released soon with add features.

## From Where it came

As a student in WDI with General Assembly in a course sponsored by MISK after finishing a good part of the front end HTML, CSS, and JS I have given this task to build this game from scratch. I hesitated at the beginning of working on it but fortunately I developed my skills and reach a good point. However, I find myself lack of time to complete all what I think to do. Thus, due to the deadline I choose to remove a lot of uncompleted features to make the game work with its current features.

## How to play

It is not that hard game. However, please note that this version may have some errors and I appreciate your patient.

## Unsolved Problems

I was working to introduce some new features when I ran of time and find myself forced to submit this version. The main feature that may make some problems is playing with AI. After some time to build on this feature and went back to remove it so there may be some code left due to eliminating this feature.
